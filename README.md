CowboyElixirExample
===================

Examples of using the cowboy web server framework in Elixir.  I wrote these because the only other good example I could find was out of date - it had been written before Hex became a thing, and didn't work with current versions of Elixir.

This one is tested to work with:
* Elixir 0.15.1
* Cowboy 

Examples included:
------------------

* Serving static files
* Accepting a GET request and replying with a JSON object
* Opening a websocket and pushing a reply to the client periodically
